## 🌞 Solar Panel Efficiency AI

### 🧠 What is This AI?

This is a **machine learning classification model** designed to analyze solar panel sensor data and automatically **predict the charging efficiency level** — whether it's **High** or **Medium** — based on environmental and electrical conditions.

It's a smart assistant for solar energy monitoring, helping you understand:

* How well your solar system is performing
* When efficiency drops
* How temperature, humidity, and time of day affect performance

### 🎯 Project Goal

> **Automatically predict the efficiency level of a solar panel system using sensor data.**

Instead of manually calculating voltage, current, and checking conditions, this AI learns from historical data and makes fast, reliable predictions for you.

### ⚙️ What Does It Do?

Given the following sensor inputs:

* 🌡️ `Temperature`
* 💧 `Humidity`
* 🔌 `Voltage`
* ⚡ `Current`
* ⏰ `Hour of the day`

The AI will predict:

* ✅ `High Efficiency`
* ⚠️ `Medium Efficiency`

---

### 🛠️ Use Cases

* 🔋 Solar charging efficiency monitoring (IoT projects)
* 📊 Real-time dashboards in mobile/web apps
* 🧪 Solar research & analysis
* 🚨 Efficiency-based alerts or automation

---

### 🧪 How It Works (Under the Hood)

1. **Calculate Power**

   ```
   power = voltage × current
   ```

2. **Normalize Efficiency**
   Efficiency is measured relative to the highest observed power in the dataset.

3. **Label Data**

   * **High**: ≥ 70% of max power
   * **Medium**: 40%–69% of max power

4. **Train AI Model**
   A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained to learn the relationship between inputs and efficiency.

5. **Make Predictions**
   Given new sensor data, the model outputs the most likely efficiency class.
